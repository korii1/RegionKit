## The Goal

Our goal for region kit is to have a unified mod to hold objects, room effects, and region infrastructure, so that region creators only need to look for one place rather than worry about the need to use another region's code mod. 


## Features

### Disabled or changed during port
- \[disabled\] Arena Management
  	- Text file that can be placed inside a subfolder in the levels folder to manage custom arenas.
- \[disabled\] ConditionalEffects
- \[disabled\] FogOfWar
- \[disabled\] CustomArenaDivisions
- \[changed\] EchoExtender - configs now work by name (White/Yellow/Red)

### Particle system

RegionKit provides a general purpose particle system, featuring:
  - Use of arbitrary sprites
  - Controlled randomization of visuals and movement
  - Modularity: combine visuals, behaviour and modifiers in any way you like.
  - Expandability:
	- Relatively simple to make user defined behaviours
	- Basework for making new types of emitters, particle classes and behaviour modifier classes

For more detailed instructions, see: [this file](./docs/P_GUIDE.md).

### Asset loading
RegionKit packs an instance of CSL by Henpemaz. It allows the user to easily load arbitrary sprites.
Automatically loads all atlases from assetpath `assets/regionkit` (recursively)
